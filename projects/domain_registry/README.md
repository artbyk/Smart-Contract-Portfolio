# Domain registry

This project encompasses two subprojects, each providing a different implementation of a domain registry using Solidity smart contracts. The first subproject presents a basic version of a domain registry, while the second subproject offers a more advanced version featuring upgradeable functionality and an oracle for price tracking and multi-currency payments.
