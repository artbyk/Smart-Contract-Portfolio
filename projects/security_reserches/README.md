# Security Researches

This repository contains a collection of comprehensive security audits and research conducted on various smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Each project folder includes detailed reports and notes that were generated throughout the auditing process, providing insights into the security posture of the projects evaluated.

## Features

- **In-Depth Security Audits**: Each project folder contains a PDF report that outlines the findings from the security audit, including identified vulnerabilities, risk assessments, and recommendations for improvement.

- **Research Notes**: Accompanying each audit report, you will find notes that document the methodology and thought process during the research and auditing phases. These notes provide transparency into the techniques used to evaluate the contracts.

- **Diverse Project Coverage**: The repository covers a variety of projects, demonstrating the breadth of the security research conducted. This includes audits of smart contracts, protocols, and dApps across different use cases.

- **Focus on Best Practices**: The audits emphasize security best practices in smart contract development, including adherence to standards, effective testing strategies, and recommendations for secure deployment.

## Objectives

The main objective of the security research projects is to enhance the security of blockchain-based applications by identifying potential vulnerabilities and providing actionable insights for developers. By conducting thorough audits and documenting the findings, the goal is to contribute to the overall security and reliability of the Ethereum ecosystem.
