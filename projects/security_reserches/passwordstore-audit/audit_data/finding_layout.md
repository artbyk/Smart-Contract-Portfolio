### [H-1] Passwords Stored On-Chain are Visible to Everyone

**Description:** All data stored on the blockchain is publicly accessible and can be directly read by anyone. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is designed to be private and should only be accessed via the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended for use only by the contract owner. However, this variable can be read directly through various off-chain methods.

**Impact:** The password is not private.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test case demonstrates how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain. We use the [foundry's cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tool to read from the contract's storage without being the owner.

1. Create a locally running chain:
    ```bash
    make anvil
    ```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain:
    ```bash
    make deploy 
    ```

3. Run the storage tool:
    ```bash
    cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```

This command returns an output similar to:
    ```
    0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
    ```

You can convert this hex value to a string with:
    ```bash
    cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
    ```

Resulting in:
    ```
    myPassword
    ```

**Recommended Mitigation:** The contract's overall architecture should be revised. One approach is to encrypt the password off-chain and store only the encrypted version on-chain. This would require users to remember an off-chain password to decrypt the stored password. Additionally, removing the view function is advisable to prevent users from accidentally revealing the password in a transaction.

### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` is Callable by Anyone

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is declared as `external`, but the function's documentation states that only the owner should be able to set a new password.

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
        // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set or change the contract's password.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test suite:

```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control modifier to the `setPassword` function:

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

### [I-1] Incorrect Natspec for `PasswordStore::getPassword`

**Description:** The natspec comment for the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function incorrectly indicates a parameter that does not exist, causing the documentation to be misleading.

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
```

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line:

```diff
-     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```

### [L-2] Initialization Timeframe Vulnerability

**Description:** The PasswordStore contract has a vulnerability during the initialization timeframe. Between contract deployment and the explicit call to `setPassword`, the password remains in its default state. Even after fixing this issue, the public nature of blockchain data means the password's visibility cannot be completely hidden.

**Impact:** During the initialization timeframe, the contract's password is empty, potentially allowing unauthorized access or unintended behavior.

**Recommended Mitigation:** To address the initialization timeframe vulnerability, set an initial password value during the contract's deployment (in the constructor). This value can be passed as a parameter to the constructor.
